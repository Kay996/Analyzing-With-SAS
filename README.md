This project explores key factors influencing academic performance in Sixth Form and Further Education (FE) colleges across the UK using SAS for statistical programming and data analysis.

Objectives
The analysis investigates the relationship between contact learning hours, pass rates, and several demographic and institutional variables, including:
Gender
Institution size
Academic year
Geographic region
College type (Sixth Form vs. FE College)
Additionally, the project examines potential bidirectional effects (eg. how region affects pass rate and how pass rate trends vary across regions) and interaction effects between variables.

Tools & Methods
Software: SAS
Techniques: Data manipulation, statistical modeling (parametrics & non-parametrics), regression analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

Goals
Identify trends and correlations impacting student outcomes.
Provide insights to inform educational strategies and policy decisions.
Demonstrate proficiency in using SAS for real-world data analysis.
