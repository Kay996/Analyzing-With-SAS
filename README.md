# Overview
This project explores key factors influencing academic performance in Sixth Form and Further Education (FE) colleges across the UK using SAS for statistical programming and data analysis.

# Objectives
The analysis investigates the relationship between contact learning hours, pass rates, and several demographic and institutional variables, including:
- Gender
- Institution size
- Academic year
- Region
- College type (Sixth Form vs. FE College)
- Additionally, the project examines potential bidirectional effects (eg. how region affects pass rate and how pass rate trends vary across regions) and interaction effects -between variables.

# Implementation
The project is developed using SAS, leveraging its capabilities in data handling, statistical modeling, and visualization. Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and transformation 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect patterns and outliers  
- Statistical modeling: including both parametric and non-parametric methods  
- Regression analysis to quantify relationships between variables  
- Data visualization to effectively communicate trends and comparisons  

# Goals
Identify trends and correlations impacting student outcomes.
Provide insights to inform educational strategies and policy decisions.
Demonstrate proficiency in using SAS for real-world data analysis.

# Results & Discussion
The institution type always had significant impact on both the pass rate, contact hour per learner and vaf. Due to interaction effect analysis, it was assumed that the Six Form Colleges performing better than FE did not change across regions. According to the overall analysis, the region did not play a part in variances of the outcomes of pass
rate, vaf and while contributing to the variation for the contact hour per learner. There was no evidence of the variations between the male and female graduated rate; one specific gender did not academically perform better than the other. Unexpectedly, the change in size did not really affect the pass rate of the students regarding the analysis of impact of size on the pass rate. It means that the higher contact hour per learner did not contribute to the higher pass rate. In terms of the impact of vaf on pass rate with regression analysis, it turned out the vaf such as the learning environment, academic support, etc. partly contributed to
academic success of the students.
